# 🌿 Anima App Vision & Build Prompts

## 🎀 The Vision
- **Nostalgia Reborn:** Instead of dress-up dolls or digital pets, users nurture *their inner self* and *ritual garden*.
- **Play + Purpose:** The app feels delightful and interactive, while also guiding people into journaling, breathwork, and plant learning.
- **Editorial Fantasy:** Think *Barbie Fairytopia* meets *Vogue Wellness* — ethereal but grown-up, chic, and not cartoonish.

---

## 🌱 Gamified Core Loop
- **Ritual Garden:** Every journal, meditation, or breathwork session grows your “garden.” Themes change based on your chosen world (Forest / Ocean / Mycelium).
- **Collectibles:** Earn shimmering “spores,” “shells,” or “leaves” that unlock bonus recipes, plant wisdom, or guided meditations.
- **Levels of Growth:** Seed → Sprout → Bloom → Grove → Sacred Sanctuary. Each level adds a new visual flourish.

## 🧸 Nostalgic Features Modernized
| Then (Barbie/Webkinz) | Now (Anima) |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Dress-up dolls, rooms  | Theme switching (Forest, Ocean, Mycelium) with chic, editorial UI |
| Mini-games             | Interactive activities (plant ally quiz, guided rituals, ritual garden tending) |
| Collectible items      | Unlockable recipes, meditations, plant cards |
| Friends lists          | (Optional) community ritual circles or shared gardens |
| Fantasy music          | Ethereal soundscapes + modern ambient tracks |

---

## ✨ Productivity Meets Play
- **Voice-to-Text Journaling:** Feels like dictating your thoughts into a magic diary.
- **Breathwork Classes:** Orb animations become living, glowing companions that breathe with you.
- **Meditations:** Unlockable journeys — completing streaks reveals deeper meditations like “Underwater Calm” (Ocean theme) or “Sacred Mycelium Path.”
- **Recipes & Plants:** Turn your collectibles into real-world rituals — e.g., unlock a “Calm Tea” recipe after growing your ritual sprout.

---

## 🔮 Futuristic Edge
- **AI-assisted Ritual Coach:** Suggests the best meditation/recipe/plant based on mood logs.
- **Augmented Reality (later stretch goal):** Scan a plant or herb and Anima tells you its folklore + uses, with a magical overlay.
- **Voice Companion Mode:** Hands-free journaling and breathwork guidance.
