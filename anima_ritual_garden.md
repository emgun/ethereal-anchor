# 🌱 Anima Ritual Garden — Interactive Concept

This document outlines the **Ritual Garden** feature for Anima, designed to be an interactive, playful-yet-chic core experience.

---

## 🎨 Visual World
- **Theme-specific worlds:**  
  - **Ocean** → shimmering shells, glowing corals, bioluminescent sea plants.  
  - **Forest** → leaves, vines, blossoms, firefly glows.  
  - **Desert/Mycelium** → glowing spores, cacti blooms, sacred mushrooms.  
- **Background evolves** as streak/progress grows (seed → sprout → bloom → sanctuary).  

---

## 🪞 Collectibles System
- **Types of charms:**  
  - 🌱 Seeds / Leaves (Forest)  
  - 🐚 Shells (Ocean)  
  - 🍄 Spores (Mycelium)  
- Users earn them through rituals (journal, meditation, breathwork, recipes, plant knowledge).  
- Collectibles appear as **floating, tappable items in the garden**.  
  - When tapped → a soft glow animation + name/meaning pops up.  
  - Example: “Hibiscus Seed — Symbol of Clarity.”  

---

## 🌸 Growth Stages
- **Seedling → Sprout → Bloom → Grove → Sanctuary**  
- Each milestone adds **new interactive layers**:  
  - More plants grow in.  
  - Glowing particles float around.  
  - Background music shifts (forest hum, ocean chime, desert wind).  
  - Subtle day/night cycles.  

---

## 🕹 Interactivity
- Users **enter their garden** from the Home screen → it’s a mini-world, not just a static progress bar.  
- They can:  
  - Scroll/pan around the garden.  
  - Tap collectibles to learn about them.  
  - Unlock “ritual cards” (plants, recipes, lore) when they find enough of a collectible.  
  - Zoom in on their sanctuary centerpiece (tree / coral / mushroom cluster).  

---

## ✨ Rewards & Motivation
- **Daily Rituals** → garden grows a little.  
- **Streaks** → unlock new collectibles and environmental changes.  
- **Surprise moments**: occasionally, a rare collectible (golden shell, radiant spore) appears — gives a bigger reward.

## 🌟 Dev Prompt (for build)
> Build an **interactive Ritual Garden** where the user’s chosen theme (Ocean, Forest, Mycelium/Desert) determines the environment.  
> - The garden **evolves in stages** (seed → sprout → bloom → sanctuary).  
> - Users earn **collectibles** (seeds, shells, spores, leaves) from daily rituals.  
> - Collectibles appear **in the garden as tappable objects** with glow animations + short meaning blurbs.  
> - Garden interactivity: pan/scroll, tap to collect, zoom on sanctuary centerpiece.  
> - Visual/audio layers expand as progress grows: background plants, ambient music, glowing particles.  
> - Rare collectibles appear occasionally as surprise rewards.  
> The garden should feel **magical, playful, and chic** — nostalgic like Webkinz, but modern like Apple design.
